    Function to generate random number to represent head (1) or tail (0) in a coin toss. 
    What I did here is to generate an integer number between 0 and 4, and if it is one, then return one (head), 
    otherwise return zero (tail). This is to say, the probability of getting a head is 0.25, so it is a biased coin.

    The assumption here is that each toss is independent of the others, and we use a binomial to model 
    the likelihood function. Because we don't know have any idea of the fairness of the coin, we just
    use a uniform distribution to model the prior.
