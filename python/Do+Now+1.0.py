# To print the decimal grade you do:

# CHANGE ME
Q0 = 0 # Quiz 1
Q1 = 0 # Quiz 2
Q2 = 0 # Quiz 3

# How can we give each quiz its percentage grade?
print(Q0)
print(Q1)
print(Q2)

# Now let's create an average of the quizes
# In this case, what is n?
n = -1 # This is not right! Change me

# Now use the formula above to compute the mean
# We suggest you break this down into 2 steps
# First, compute the total score (IE, the sum over all quiz scores)
total = -1 # FIX ME

# Then, divide by the number of quizzes taken
avg = total/n


# We can see that april did alright for her quizes. 
# Can we double check that she can is passing with more than an 80%?

print(avg >= 80)

# pop quiz: what data type is the average score (avg)?
# Verify your guess below using the type function


# Now if we have to make it pretty. We need to put the grades, averages, and the name of the student in one line
# we want it to say: Hello April. Your quiz grades are ..., ..., ..., with an average of ...%.
