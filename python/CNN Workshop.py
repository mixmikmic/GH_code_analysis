# TODO Add your imports

# TODO Load in MNIST data

# TODO Define placeholders

# TODO Define hyperparameters

# TODO Define helper functions

# TODO Create variables/operations that pass our input into our first conv-pool layer. This 
# involves creating a weight matrix, a bias term, and using our conv and pool helper functions

# TODO Do the same for the 2nd layer. Let's say we want to have 64 different output activation
# maps. 

# TODO Now that we're done with our convolutional layers, let's add in some fully connected layer. 
# Think about what the shape of our input is right now, and let's think about how we can modify it
# so that we get closer to our goal of getting predictions for the 10 classes

# TODO Create another fully connected layer where the input has 1024 units and the output has 256

# TODO Create the last FC layer that eventually gets us to our predictions for the 10 classes

# TODO Define the loss function and our optimizer

# TODO Define accuracy metrics

# TODO Create training loop

# TODO Test network on test images
