# CHOOSING COLOR PALETTES
# The most important function for working with discrete 
# color palettes is color_palette(). This function provides an 
# interface to many (though not all) of the possible ways you can
# generate colors in seaborn, and it’s used internally by any function 
# that has a palette argument (and in some cases for a color
# argument when multiple colors are needed).
# color_palette() will accept the name of any seaborn palette or 
# matplotlib colormap (except jet, which you should never use).
# It can also take a list of colors specified in any valid matplotlib 
# format (RGB tuples, hex color codes, or HTML color names). The 
# return value is always a list of RGB tuples.

# Finally, calling color_palette() with no arguments will return the
# current default color cycle.

# A corresponding function, set_palette(), takes the same arguments
# and will set the default color cycle for all plots. You can also
# use color_palette() in a with statement to temporarily change the
# default palette (see below).

# It is generally not possible to know what kind of color palette or
# colormap is best for a set of data without knowing about the
# characteristics of the data. Following that, we’ll break up 
# the different ways to use color_palette() and other seaborn
# palette functions by the three general kinds of color palettes:

# **************qualitative, sequential, and diverging***********

# PART-2 PLOTTING FUNCTIONS
## VISUALIZING THE DISTRIBUTION OF A DATASET

# plotting univariate distribution
# The most convenient way to take a quick look at a univariate 
# distribution in seaborn is the distplot() function.By default
# this will draw a histogram and fit a kernel density estimate
x=np.random.normal(size=100)
sns.set()
sns.distplot(x)

# histogram
# histograms are likely familiar and a hist function already exists
# in matplotlib.A histogram represents the distribution of data by 
# forming bins along the range of the data nd then drawing bars to 
# show the number of observations that fall in each bin
# To illustrate this ,let's remove the desinty curve and add a rug
# plot,which draws a small vertical tick t each observation.You can 
# make the rug plot itself with the rugplot function but it is also 
# available in distplot()
sns.distplot(x,kde=False,rug=True)

# when drawing histograms the main choice you have is the number of
# bins to use and where to place them.Distplot() uses a simple rule
# to make good guess for what the right number is the default,but
# trying more or fewer bins might reveal other features in the data
sns.distplot(x,bins=20,rug=True,kde=False)

# KERNEL DENSITY ESTIMATION
# the kernel density estimate may be less familiar but it can be a
# useful tool for plotting the shape of a distribution.Like the
# hsitogram,the KDE plots encodes the density of observations on one
# axis with height along the other axis:
sns.distplot(x,hist=False,rug=True)

sns.kdeplot(x,shade=True)
sns.rugplot(x)

# the bandwidth parameter of the KDE controls how tightly the 
# estiamtion is to fit to the data,much like the bin size in a 
# histogram.It corresponds to the width of the kernels.The default
# behaviour tries to guess a good vlue using a common reference rule
# ,but it my be helpful to try larger or smaller values
sns.kdeplot(x)
sns.kdeplot(x,bw=2,label='bw:2')
sns.kdeplot(x,bw=0.2,label='bw:0.2')

# Fitting parametric distributions
# you can also use the distplot() to fit a parametric distribution
# to a dataset and visually evaluate how closely it corresponds to
# the observed data:
x=np.random.gamma(6,size=200)
from scipy import stats
sns.distplot(x,kde=False,fit=stats.gamma)

# Plotting Bivariate distributions
# The easiest way to do this in seaborn is to just use the joinplot()
# function,which creates a multi-panel figure that shows both the 
# bivariate(or joint) relationship between two variables along 
# with the univariate (or marginal) distributiob of each on separate
# axis
mean,cov=[0,1],[(1,0.5),(0.5,1)]
data=np.random.multivariate_normal(mean,cov,200)
df=pd.DataFrame(data,columns=['x','y'])
print(df)

# Scatterplots
# the most familiar way to visualize a bivariate distribution is
# a scatterlpot,where each observation is shown with point at the 
# x and y values.This is analogous to rugplot on two dimesnions
# .You can draw a Scatterplot with the matplotlib plt.scatter,and
# it is also the default kind of plot shown by the jointplot()
# function:
sns.jointplot(x='x',y='y',data=df)

# Hesxbin plots
# the bivariate analogue of a histogram is known as a hexbin plot 
# because it shows the count of observations that fall within 
# hexagonal bins.this plot works best with relatively large datasets.
# it's availble through the matplotlib plt.hexbin() function and as
# a style in jointplot.it looks best with a white background
x,y=np.random.multivariate_normal(mean,cov,1000).T
with sns.axes_style('white'):
    sns.jointplot(x=x,y=y,kind='hex',color='k')

# kernel density estimation
# it is also possible to use the kernel density estimation procedure
# described above to visualoze a bivariate distribution.In seaborn,
# this kind of plot is shown with a contour plot and is available
# as a style in jointplot()
sns.jointplot(x=x,y=y,kind='kde')

# you can also draw a 2d kernel density plot with the kdeplot()
# function.This allows you to draw this kind of plot onto a specific
# matplotlib axes,whereas the joint plot() function manages it's own
# figure
f,ax=plt.subplots()
sns.kdeplot(df['x'],df['y'],ax=ax)
sns.rugplot(df['x'],color='g',ax=ax)
sns.rugplot(df['y'],color='b',ax=ax,vertical=True)

# if you wish to show the bivariate density more continously,you can
# simply increase the number of contour levels:
cmap = sns.cubehelix_palette(as_cmap=True, dark=0, light=1,
reverse=True)

sns.kdeplot(df['x'],df['y'],n_levels=60,shade=True,cmap=cmap)

# the jointplot function uses a jointgrid to manage the figure.For
# more flexibility,you my want to draw your figure by using JointGrid
# directly.Jointplot() return the JointGrid object after plotting
# which you can use to add more layers or to tweak other aspects of
# the visualization
g=sns.jointplot(x='x',y='x',data=df,kind='kde',color='b')
g.plot_joint(plt.scatter,c='w',s=30,linewidth=1,marker='+')
g.ax_joint.collections[0].set_alpha(0)
g.set_axis_labels('$x$','$y$')

# visualising pairwise relationships in a dataset
# To plot multiple pairwise bivariate distributions in a dataset,you
# can use the pirplot() function.This creates a matrix of axes
# and shows the relationship for each pair of columns in a DataFrame
# By default,it also draws the univariate distribution of each
# variable on the diagonal axes
iris=sns.load_dataset('iris')
sns.pairplot(iris)

# Much like the relationship between jointplot() and JointGrid , 
# the pairplot() function is built on top of a PairGrid object,which
# can be used directly for more flexibility:
g=sns.pairplot(iris)
g.map_diag(sns.kdeplot)
g.map_offdiag(sns.kdeplot,cmap='Blues_d',n_levels=6)

# **************** Plotting with categorical data ***************


# It’s useful to divide seaborn’s categorical plots into three groups:
# those that show each observation at each level of the categorical 
# variable, those that show an abstract representation of each
# distribution of observations, and those that apply a statistical 
# estimation to show a measure of central tendency and confidence
# interval. The first includes the functions swarmplot() and 
# stripplot(), the second includes boxplot() and violinplot(), and 
# the third includes barplot() and pointplot(). These functions all 
# share a basic API for how they accept data, although each has
# specific parameters that control the particulars of the
# visualization that is applied to that data.

# Much like the relationship between regplot() and lmplot(), in
# seaborn there are both relatively low-level and relatively 
# high-level approaches for making categorical plots. The functions
# named above are all low-level in that they plot onto a specific
# matplotlib axes. There is also the higher-level factorplot(),
# which combines these functions with a FacetGrid to apply a 
# categorical plot across a grid of figure panels

sns.set(style='whitegrid',color_codes=True)

titanic=sns.load_dataset('titanic')
tips=sns.load_dataset('tips')
iris=sns.load_dataset('iris')

# Categorical scatterplots
# a simple way to show the values of some quantitative variable 
# across the levels of a categorical variable uses stripplot(),which
# generalizes a scatterplot to the case where one of the variables
# is categorical
sns.stripplot(x='day',y='total_bill',data=tips)

# in a strip plot the scatterplot points will usually overlap.this 
# makes it difficult to see the full distribution of data.One easy
# solution is to adjust the positions (only along the categorical
# axis) using some random jitter
sns.stripplot(x='day',y='total_bill',data=tips,jitter=True)

# a different approach would be to use the function swarmplot(),which
# positions each scatterplot point on the categorical axis with
# an algorithm that avoids overlapping points
sns.swarmplot(x='day',y='total_bill',data=tips)

# It's also possible to add a nested categorical variable with the 
# hue parameter.Above the color and position on the categorical 
# axis are redundant,but now each provides info about one of the 
# two variables
sns.swarmplot(x='day',y='total_bill',hue='sex',data=tips)

# In general, the seaborn categorical plotting functions try to 
# infer the order of categories from the data. If your data have a 
# pandas Categorical datatype, then the default order of the 
# categories can be set there. For other datatypes, string-typed 
# categories will be plotted in the order they appear in the 
# DataFrame, but categories that look numerical will be sorted:
sns.swarmplot(x='size',y='total_bill',data=tips)

# With these plots, it’s often helpful to put the categorical variable
# on the vertical axis (this is particularly useful when the category
# names are relatively long or there are many categories). You can 
# force an orientation using the orient keyword, but usually plot 
# orientation can be inferred from the datatypes of the variables 
# passed to x and/or y:
sns.swarmplot(x='total_bill',y='day',hue='sex',data=tips)

# ***** Distribution of observations within categories ******
# Boxplots

# This kind of plot shows the three quartile values of the 
# distribution along with extreme values. The “whiskers” extend to 
# points that lie within 1.5 IQRs of the lower and upper quartile,
# and then observations that fall outside this range are displayed 
# independently. Importantly, this means that each value in the 
# boxplot corresponds to an actual observation in the data:

sns.boxplot(x='day',y='total_bill',data=tips)

# For boxplots, the assumption when using a hue variable is that it 
# is nested within the x or y variable. This means that by default,
# the boxes for different levels of hue will be offset, as you can see
# above. If your hue variable is not nested, you can set the dodge
# parameter to disable offsetting:

sns.boxplot(x='day',y='total_bill',hue='time',data=tips)

tips['weekend']=tips['day'].isin(['Sat','Sun'])
sns.boxplot(x='day',y='total_bill',hue='weekend',data=tips,
dodge=False)

# ViolinPlots
# A different approach is a violinplot(),which combines a boxplot 
# with the kernel density estimation procedure

sns.violinplot(x='total_bill',y='day',data=tips,hue='time')

# This approach uses the kernel density estimate to provide a better 
# description of the distribution of values. Additionally,
# the quartile and whikser values from the boxplot are shown inside 
# the violin. Because the violinplot uses a KDE, there are some other 
# parameters that may need tweaking, adding some complexity relative 
# to the straightforward boxplot:

sns.violinplot(x='total_bill',y='day',hue='time',data=tips,
bw=0.1,scale='count',scale_hue=False)


# It’s also possible to “split” the violins when the hue parameter 
# has only two levels, which can allow for a more efficient use of 
# space:
sns.violinplot(x='day',y='total_bill',hue='sex',data=tips,split=True)


# Finally, there are several options for the plot that is drawn on 
# the interior of the violins, including ways to show each individual 
# observation instead of the summary boxplot values:

sns.violinplot(x='day',y='total_bill',hue='sex',data=tips,
split=True,inner='stick',palette='Set2')

# It can also be useful to combine stripplot() or swarmplot() 
# with violinplot() or boxplot() to show each observation along 
# with a summary of the distribution:

sns.violinplot(x='day',y='total_bill',data=tips)
sns.swarmplot(x='day',y='total_bill',data=tips,color='w',alpha=0.5)

# *********** Statistical Estimation Within Categories ***********

# Often, rather than showing the distribution within each category,
# you might want to show the central tendency of the values.

# BAR PLOT:
# In seaborn,the braplot() function operates on a full dataset and 
# shows an arbitrary estimate,using the mean by default.When there
# are multiple obersvations in each category,it also uses
# bootstrapping to compute a confidence interval around the estimate
# and plots that using error bars

sns.barplot(x='sex',y='survived',data=titanic)

sns.barplot(x='sex',y='survived',hue='class',data=titanic)

# A special case for the bar plot is when you want to show the number 
# of observations in each category rather than computing a statistic 
# for a second variable. This is similar to a histogram over a 
# categorical, rather than quantitative, variable. In seaborn, it’s 
# easy to do so with the countplot() function:

sns.countplot(x='deck',data=titanic)

sns.countplot(x='deck',hue='class',data=titanic)

# POINT PLOTS:

# An alternative style for visualizing the same information is 
# offered by the pointplot() function. This function also encodes
# the value of the estimate with height on the other axis, but rather 
# than show a full bar it just plots the point estimate and confidence
# interval. Additionally, pointplot connects points from the same hue 
# category. This makes it easy to see how the main relationship is 
# changing as a function of a second variable, because your eyes are
# quite good at picking up on differences of slopes:

sns.pointplot(x='sex',y='survived',data=titanic)

sns.pointplot(x='sex',y='survived',hue='class',data=titanic)

# To make figures that reproduce well in black and white, it can be 
# good to use different markers and line styles for the levels of 
# the hue category:

sns.pointplot(x='class',y='survived',hue='sex',data=titanic,
palette={'male':'g','female':'m'},markers=['o','^'],
linestyles=['--','-'])

# PLOTTING " WIDE-FORM " DATA

# While using “long-form” or “tidy” data is preferred, these 
# functions can also by applied to “wide-form” data in a variety of
# formats, including pandas DataFrames or two-dimensional numpy 
# arrays. These objects should be passed directly to the data 
# parameter:

sns.boxplot(data=iris)

# Additionally, these functions accept vectors of Pandas or
# numpy objects rather than variables in a DataFrame:

sns.violinplot(x='species',y='sepal_length',data=iris)

# Drawing multi-panel categorical plots
# As we mentioned above, there are two ways to draw categorical plots
# in seaborn. Similar to the duality in the regression plots, you can
# either use the functions introduced above, or the higher-level 
# function factorplot(), which combines these functions with a 
# FacetGrid() to add the ability to examine additional categories 
# through the larger structure of the figure. By default, 
# factorplot() produces a pointplot():

sns.factorplot(x='day',y='total_bill',data=tips)

sns.factorplot(x='day',y='total_bill',hue='smoker',data=tips)

# However, the kind parameter lets you chose any of the kinds of 
# plots discussed above:

sns.factorplot(x='day',y='total_bill',data=tips,kind='bar',
               hue='smoker')

# The main advantage of using a factorplot() is that it is very easy
# to “facet” the plot and investigate the role of other categorical 
# variables:

sns.factorplot(x='day',y='total_bill',hue='smoker',data=tips,
              kind='swarm',col='time')

# Any kind of plot can be drawn. Because of the way FacetGrid works,
# to change the size and shape of the figure you need to specify 
# the size and aspect arguments, which apply to each facet:

sns.factorplot(x='time',y='total_bill',hue='smoker',col='day',
               data=tips,kind='box',size=4,aspect=0.5)

# It is important to note that you could also make this plot by
# using boxplot() and FacetGrid directly. However, special care must
# be taken to ensure that the order of the categorical variables is 
# enforced in each facet, either by using data with a Categorical 
# datatype or by passing order and hue_order.

# Because of the generalized API of the categorical plots, they 
# should be easy to apply to other more complex contexts. For
# example, they are easily combined with a PairGrid to show 
# categorical relationships across several different variables:

g=sns.PairGrid(tips,x_vars=['smoker','time','sex'],
              y_vars=['total_bill','tip'],aspect=0.75,size=3.5)
g.map(sns.violinplot,palette='pastel')

# # VISUALIZING LINEAR RELATIONSHIPS
# the regression plots in seaborn are primarily intended to add a 
# visual guide that helps to emphasize patterns in a dataset during 
# exploratory data analyses. That is to say that seaborn is not itself
# a package for statistical analysis. To obtain quantitative measures 
# related to the fit of regression models, you should use statsmodels.
# The goal of seaborn, however, is to make exploring a dataset through
# visualization quick and easy, as doing so is just as (if not more)
# important than exploring a dataset through tables of statistics.

# FUNCTIONS TO DRAW LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS
# Two main functions in seaborn are used to visualize a linear 
# relationship as determined through regression. These functions, 
# regplot() and lmplot() are closely related, and share much of their 
# core functionality. It is important to understand the ways they
# differ, however, so that you can quickly choose the correct tool 
# for particular job.

# In the simplest invocation, both functions draw a scatterplot of 
# two variables, x and y, and then fit the regression model y ~ x 
# and plot the resulting regression line and a 95% confidence 
# interval for that regression:

sns.regplot(x='total_bill',y='tip',data=tips)

sns.lmplot(x='total_bill',y='tip',data=tips)

# You should note that the resulting plots are identical,
# except that the figure shapes are different. We will explain
# why this is shortly. For now, the other main difference to know
# about is that regplot() accepts the x and y variables in a variety 
# of formats including simple numpy arrays, pandas Series objects,
# or as references to variables in a pandas DataFrame object passed 
# to data. In contrast, lmplot() has data as a required parameter and 
# the x and y variables must be specified as strings. This data 
# format is called “long-form” or “tidy” data. Other than this input
# flexibility, regplot() possesses a subset of lmplot()‘s features,
# so we will demonstrate them using the latter.

# It’s possible to fit a linear regression when one of the variables
# takes discrete values, however, the simple scatterplot produced by 
# this kind of dataset is often not optimal

sns.lmplot(x='size',y='tip',data=tips)

# One option is to add some random noise (“jitter”) to the discrete
# values to make the distribution of those values more clear. Note 
# that jitter is applied only to the scatterplot data and does not 
# influence the regression line fit itself:

sns.lmplot(x='size',y='tip',data=tips,x_jitter=0.1)

# A second option is to collapse over the observations in each
# discrete bin to plot an estimate of central tendency along with
# a confidence interval:

sns.lmplot(x='size',y='tip',data=tips,x_estimator=np.mean)

# CONDITIONING ON OTHER VARIABLES
# The plots above show many ways to explore the relationship between
# a pair of variables. Often, however, a more interesting question
# is “how does the relationship between these two variables change
# as a function of a third variable?” This is where the difference
# between regplot() and lmplot() appears. While regplot() always
# shows a single relationship, lmplot() combines regplot() with 
# FacetGrid to provide an easy interface to show a linear regression 
# on “faceted” plots that allow you to explore interactions with up
# to three additional categorical variables.

# The best way to separate out a relationship is to plot both levels
# on the same axes and to use color to distinguish them:

sns.set(color_codes=True)
sns.lmplot(x='total_bill',y='tip',hue='smoker',data=tips)

# In addition to color, it’s possible to use different scatterplot
# markers to make plots the reproduce to black and white better.
# You also have full control over the colors used:

sns.lmplot(x='total_bill',y='tip',hue='smoker',markers=['o','x'],
          palette='Set1',data=tips)

# To add another variable, you can draw multiple “facets” which 
# each level of the variable appearing in the rows or columns of the
# grid:

sns.lmplot(x='total_bill',y='tip',hue='smoker',col='time',data=tips)

sns.lmplot(x='total_bill',y='tip',hue='smoker',col='time',row='sex',
          data=tips)
